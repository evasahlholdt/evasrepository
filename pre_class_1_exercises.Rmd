## Pre-class 1 Exercises

The warm-up for class will use the mtcars dataset which is always present in R.
The following code shows you how load the dataset

```{r load the data}
pacman::p_load(pacman, tidyverse) #laod packages
? mtcars # what are the variables
cars <- mtcars %>% rownames_to_column(var = "type") # tranform to tibble (tidyverse-compatible)
show(cars)
```


This a brief re-introduction to the tidyverse package in R

This is something we went through during 1st semester so you should be able to do it, however if the summer have been to harsh I recommend consulting R for data science chapter 5: https://r4ds.had.co.nz
```{r}
# Using mutate - convert miles per gallon to liters (divided by amount of litres on a gallon)

cars<-mutate(cars,mpl=mpg/3.78541178)

# Using filter - find all the cars which have more that 4 gears and are automatic

filter(cars,gear>4,am==0) #if more than 4
filter(cars,gear>=4,am==0) #if 4 or more

# Using select - create a column dataframe with only miles pr. gallon, weight and number of gears

select(cars,mpg,wt,gear)

# Using arrange - What cars are most fuel efficient? (lowest miles pr. liter/gallon)

arrange(cars,mpg) 

# Using Group_by and summarise - Find out how many cars have 3 gears, how many have 4 and how many have 5 (tip use n(), with summarise to count number of occurences)

by_gear<-cars%>%group_by(gear)%>%summarise(n()) 
View(by_gear)

# If you haven't yet, solve the above task using pipe, they look like this '%>%' and can be read as 'then' e.g. the following lines:
mtcars %>% 
  mutate(number = 200) %>% 
  summarise(sum_num = sum(number)) %>% 
  mutate(n_row = sum_num / 200)
# can be read as 'take mtcars, 
  # THEN add a column called numbers which is equal to 200
  # THEN the summarise the using the sum of numbers 
  # THEN divide the sum of the number by 200 to get the number of rows

#create some sort of plot plotting the data

ggplot(cars,aes(gear,mpl))+geom_bar(stat = "summary")

#just an edit

```
